This is the project material for the exercises of the tutorial.

## Repository organization
Each exercise state is on its own branch, e.g. the solution to the first exercise is on the `exercise-2` branch.

## Usage
*Note*: Please note that you'll need to run `npm install` once in order to fetch the application's dependencies, since
we did not include them in the repository.

## Issues
Please do not hesitate to open issues for any questions you have. We appreciate feedback very much!
