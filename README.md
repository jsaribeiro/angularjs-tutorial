# What every Java Developer should know about AngularJS 

This is the project material for the exercises of the tutorial.

If you have any questions, suggestions etc., feel free to contact us.

You can also download the examples as a ZIP from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0on8LO2mrLDR3ZJdENuV0NRQjQ).

## Repository organization
Each solution is tagged with the respective exercise number, so the tag `exercise-1-solution` contains the solution for the first exercise.

## Preparation
*Note*: Please note that you'll need to run `npm install` once in order to fetch the application's dependencies, since
we did not include them in the repository. This also applies if you decide to download the tags manually.
